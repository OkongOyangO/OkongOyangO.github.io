**Abstract:** We reveal that Eu-based Zintl compounds host a hybrid-order topological phase characterized by the coexistence of gapless Dirac surface states and chiral hinge modes. The system exhibits surface-dependent quantum geometry: gapped surfaces display a half-quantized anomalous Hall effect arising from Berry curvature, while the gapless facet hosts unpinned Dirac states whose nonlinear anomalous Hall response originates from the quantum metric.
