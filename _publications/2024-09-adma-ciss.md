**Abstract:** This work demonstrates magnet-free spin generation in a semiconductor by exploiting chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). Using a self-assembled monolayer of chiral molecules (α-helix L-polyalanine) to interface Au and n-doped GaAs, we show that electrical current injection creates robust spin accumulation without any magnetic field.
