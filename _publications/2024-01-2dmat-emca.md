**Abstract:** Electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (EMCA) describes a nonlinear magnetoresistance that depends on both chirality and current direction. In this work, we reveal a quantum geometric origin of EMCA using a chiral rectangular lattice model inspired by the organic conductor DM-EDT-TTF. We show that the quantum metric plays a key role in enhancing the nonlinear response, providing a geometric interpretation of magnetochiral transport in chiral conductors.
