I am a Ph.D. student in Physics at **Pennsylvania State University**, advised by **Prof. Binghai Yan**. Previously, I conducted graduate studies at the Weizmann Institute of Science (Israel) and obtained my B.S. in Physics from Tsinghua University (China).

My research focuses on **Condensed Matter Theory**, specifically exploring the intersection of topology, geometry, and nonlinear responses in quantum materials.

### 🔬 Research Interests

*   **Topology and Quantum Geometry**: Quantum metric, Berry curvature, quantum connection.
*   **Nonlinear and Nonreciprocal Responses**: Nonlinear Hall effect, nonreciprocal magnetoresistance, nonreciprocal thermal photonics.
*   **Chirality**: Chirality induced spin selectivity (CISS), electric magnetochiral anisotropy (EMCA).
*   **AI for Science**: Quantum material benchmark for large language models (LLM).

### 🎓 Education

*   **Ph.D. in Physics**, Pennsylvania State University (Aug 2024 - Present)
*   **M.Sc. in Physics**, Weizmann Institute of Science (Aug 2023 - Jun 2024)
*   **B.S. in Physics**, Tsinghua University (Aug 2019 - June 2023)
